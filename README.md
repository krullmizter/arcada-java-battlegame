### University Course | Java CMD Battlegame

A small CMD battle game written in Java 11, by me Samuel 👋 for my second year [Arcada](https://www.arcada.fi/en) datastructure and algorithm course assignment.

#### About
The main idea behind this project was to use OOP standards to create a simple CMD based game. The use of getter and setters, and arrayLists are also included in this project. We also used serialization of files to save and load game files.

The game itself isn't a 100% complete, and it its main purpose is only to show of the required tasks as I mentioned above. It does work to some extent but don't expect a 100h+ game. 🤭

The commit history isn't included as this is a new public repository.

#### Play it 🕹️

Just `git clone` and run the `Main.java` file in the `src` folder to see the game in action.
